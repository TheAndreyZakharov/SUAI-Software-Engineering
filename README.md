## Description  
This repository contains academic projects and reports for courses in the **Software Engineering** program at the **Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation (SUAI)**. It collects assignments and lab work aimed at developing programming skills and software product design.  

Each subject has a dedicated folder, with subdirectories for specific assignments. These subdirectories contain:  
- **Source code files** — the code written as part of the assignment.  
- **Project report** (`report`) — a document with a description of the task, results, and explanations.  
- **Assignment README** — a brief overview and the goal of the specific task.

Only assignments directly related to programming and software development are included in the repository. If a task does not focus on these areas, it may not be present here.

## How to Use the Repository  
1. **Navigating Courses**:  
   - The root of the repository contains folders named after each subject.  
   - Open the relevant subject folder to see the list of assignments.  

2. **Navigating Assignments**:  
   - Inside each subject folder, there are subdirectories for individual tasks.  
   - Each subdirectory includes the program files, a report (`report`), and a `README` with the assignment's objectives and requirements.

3. **Reports**:  
   - For a detailed explanation of each task, check the **reports** in each assignment folder. Reports provide the main insights, methods used, and conclusions drawn from the work.
